I am a computational neuroscience researcher currently working with [Claudia Clopath](https://cclopath.bg-research.cc.ic.ac.uk) at Imperial College London. Previously, I was a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Angus Chadwick](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/achadwic/).

My research is broadly focused on models of recurrent neural networks as dynamical systems to study neural computations. I am studying how information is encoded by neural populations and how this depends on the connectivity structure and dynamics of the networks.
